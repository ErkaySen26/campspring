# Spring Boot RESTful API Project

## Project Description
This project is built using **Spring Boot** to create a simple RESTful API that handles various operations for a specific domain (e.g., user management, product catalog, etc.). The API supports basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing resources and exposes them via RESTful endpoints.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot** (For backend application development)
- **Spring Data JPA** (For database integration)
- **H2 Database** (or another database of your choice for development)
- **RESTful API** (For providing data over HTTP)
- **Postman** (or any HTTP client for API testing)

## Features
- CRUD operations for managing resources.
- Exposes endpoints for interacting with the database.
- Uses Spring Data JPA for data persistence.
- Built with best practices for RESTful API design.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Java 8 or later**
- **Maven** (for dependency management)

### Steps to run the project

1. **Clone the repository:**
git clone https://github.com/ErkaySen26/your-spring-boot-project.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
cd your-spring-boot-project
3. **Build the project:**
mvn clean install
4. **Run the application:**

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

5. **Testing the API:**
You can test the API using tools like **Postman** or **cURL** by calling the available endpoints.

## Usage

### Example Endpoints:
- `GET /api/resources` - Get all resources
- `GET /api/resources/{id}` - Get a specific resource by ID
- `POST /api/resources` - Create a new resource
- `PUT /api/resources/{id}` - Update a resource by ID
- `DELETE /api/resources/{id}` - Delete a resource by ID

### Example API request using **Postman**:
- **GET** `http://localhost:8080/api/resources` to fetch all resources
- **POST** `http://localhost:8080/api/resources` with a JSON body to create a new resource
